# Recipes Frontend

My personal cooking recipes, not publicly available.

# Motivation

Keeping track of cooking recipes and easily searching for titles and ingredients instead of leafing through a book.

# Technical motivation

- Wanted to try out Hasura and React Admin.
- See how quick it was to spin up a new CRUD app.

The project is using Hasura hosted on a free Heroku dyno.  
https://github.com/Steams/ra-data-hasura-graphql is used as a data provider to connect the Hasura backend to the [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) frontend.
